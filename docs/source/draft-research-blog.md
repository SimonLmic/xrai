## Model Architecture

- **Problem we're Addressing:**
	- Creating a powerful and adaptable AI system to address the challenges of Mobility/Spatial Deep Learning as a service across various business scenarios.

- **Why It's Essential:**
	- **Document Signal:** Text, Audio, and Image documents have defined structures, like 2D waves for sound and 2D/3D grids for images. However, **User Spatial Sessions*** documents are unique. In our representation, they consist of sets of Spatial Datapoints with **6DOF*** coordinates, as users experience the environment in a First-Person (camera) perspective.
		- Each Datapoint lacks meaning when considered independently, requiring a connection in a Spatial Graph using our Hypergrid geometric data structure. This approach ensures a meaningful document structure for precise model training.
	- Our model specializes in delivering the best results for spatial/mobility computations, showcased in this article, accelerating advancements in this field through our AI specialization.

## Definitions for Non-Technical Audience

- **6DOF:** Stands for 6 degrees of freedom, giving users the ability to explore the digital or real world in a first-person view. It means users can move in six different ways—forward/backward, up/down, left/right, pitch, yaw, and roll.

- **User Spatial Session:** Imagine it as one activity in the Metaverse, like a unique experience you have. It has a start time, an end time, and a specific identifier, making it a distinct journey or interaction within the virtual space.


## XRAI Model Overview

**XRAI Model** is like a highly trained guide for Spatial AI—it uses advanced technologies to understand and navigate the virtual world. Think of it as the brains behind making virtual reality smart and interactive. Here's a simple breakdown:

### Architecture

XRAI employs a Structural Geometric Neural Network (GraphNN) as its core structure. It also integrates other models for processing Image, Text, and Audio signals, enhancing its abilities to provide feedback to users.

### Hypergrid

It's like a helper for the XRAI Model, sorting out data into spatial (related to space) and non-spatial categories.

- For spatial data (like where you move), it connects points to create a visual map for the specialized Model processor.
- For non-spatial data (other info), it organizes it into a table-like structure for easy handling.

### Specialized Techniques

XRAI is a Spatial AI expert, using various techniques (fancy tools like Data Normalization, GAN, Auto-Encoders, and more) to provide top-notch spatial AI computations. It's like having a high-tech assistant for virtual adventures.

### Accelerated Hardware

XRAI loves speed! It supports fancy hardware to run as XRAI accelerates Mobility/Spatial AI Deep Learning through software specialization. But, keep in mind, it's hungry for data.

### Monitoring and Control

XRAI isn't just smart; it's also self-aware. It introduces tools and metrics to watch over every step of the training and decision-making process. This ensures it stays sharp and can quickly adapt in case things go off track.

### Who Benefits?

XRAI is here for all the developers working on spatial/mobility applications. They can focus on making cool stuff while XRAI handles the complex Spatial AI parts—like a helpful sidekick for VR/AR and AI enthusiasts.

### How It Works

XRAI understands space and movement (Spatial Data), uses geometric tricks (Spatial geometric operators), and applies its knowledge (XRAI Model) for advanced 3D/6DOF AI Compute capabilities during training and real-world tasks.

Now, you have a glimpse of how XRAI makes the virtual world smarter and more interactive without needing to dive into the technical details! 🚀

## Dataset Exploration

Our mobile web app prototype, developed using Three.js and WebXR, serves as a playground for user testing data. Accessible on WebXR-enabled browsers like [Mozilla WebXR Viewer](https://apps.apple.com/fr/app/webxr-viewer/id1295998056) for IOS, it provides a glimpse into the future where headsets like Apple Vision Pro or META Quest are mainstream. Although the technical code is a work in progress, the prototype serves its purpose well and can be enhanced further with technologies like TypeScript and react-three-fiber.

### Purpose of Development

The aim was to create a mobile application sandbox to collect user testing data, especially given the lack of a suitable public dataset for our Mobility and Spatial AI use case. The prototype resembled a Stop Shop supporting both AR and VR, displaying a 3D Fantasy corner and merchant products in a digital environment.

### User Interaction

End-users could engage with the digital environment, seeing calls to action like Display or Add to Cart for 3D products. Although we didn't implement the Payment API, users could further explore personalized retail products recommended by the system, such as a motorcycle or a jacket.

### Development Output

Our development resulted in a spatial interface for end-users, incorporating visual displays, audio sounds, and integration with the XRAI Model for inference.

### Dataset Creation

- **Dataset Problem:**
  - User Spatial Sessions, a collection of spatial datapoints containing features like End-User Spatial Position coordinates, Digital Eye vector, and End-User Activities.
  - User Sessions include non-spatial data like User Agent, OS, and metadata.
  - Data was dynamically sent by our Mobile App and stored in MongoDB. To build our dataset, we developed a database connector, downloading User Spatial Sessions from around 20 testing users.

- **Choosing Our Dataset:**
  - No public dataset was available earlier, necessitating the creation of our own.
  - Capitalizing on our experience, we aim to assist others in bringing their datasets to the platform and challenging our model.

- **Who Benefits:**
  - Spatial Application Developers commercializing VR/AR applications.
  - Spatial Hardware Developers for specific industrial cases like Drone, Healthcare, or Sports.

- **Dataset Creation Steps:**
  - Filtering non-representative samples.
  - Subsetting to challenge the most complex samples through clusters (e.g., similar user sessions in-shop with a time spent between 10 and 20 seconds, only viewing products without digital interactions).
  - Blacklisting personal privacy features.
  - Normalizing sample features.

This dataset is a glimpse into the future, where advanced headsets will produce a wealth of datapoints, allowing us to refine and enhance our models for even more immersive experiences.

## Model Training

- **What's the Problem?**
  - Training needs to work across different spaces and adapt to various devices and sensors.
  - Data needs special preparation before training due to different devices and polymorphic data.
  - The 6DOF neural network used for spatial understanding demands a lot of computing power.

- **Why Solve Training?**
  - Training needs to be universal, whether it's a user with a smartphone in one space or someone with smart glasses in another.
  - The process is demanding, especially for the complex 6DOF neural network.
  - We need a robust training system that can handle different scales effortlessly.

- **Who Uses It?**
  - Data Scientists and Developers.

### How It Works

- **Achieving Seamless Training**
  - It's like Continuous Training for our smart AI system.
  - Continuous Monitoring ensures we stay on track, comparing against set benchmarks.
  - Techniques like space segmentation, normalization, and resolution adjustments maintain consistency across spaces.
  - Fine-tuning allows us to enhance the model for specific dataset clusters or new datasets.
  - Adjusting model hyperparameters is possible through a simple model structure file definition.
  - The model flows smoothly with parallelization, saving, and deployment.
  - Configuration details like batch size (3), optimizer (Adam), learning rate gamma (0.001), and weight decay (0.01) can be customized.

Training the AI model becomes a well-managed, adaptable, and efficient process, making our spatial understanding technology reliable and effective.

Due to the time and space constraints in the project, we could not expand the experiments to all the possible use-cases of XRAI. We plan to include those in our future study and add new capabilities to XRAI that would give more 


## Try out 



## Ethical Concerns

	Tracking can be sensitive to local regulation but our hyperlocal approach based on anonymous hyperlocal data is effective and can help to capture end-user behaviours and profiles.


## Conclusion


For AI-Enabled companies, have to migrate their AI implementation into the new VR/AR paradigm shift: new architecture, new product, new compute cluster and so it's faster to provide them with fast to implement AI solutions

For Not AI-Enabled companies: have to enable AI for their Business cases including direct VR/AR AI Deep Learning solutions.
